 <p><b>There are four members in my family, first is my Father who is a lotto outlet teller then my lovely Mother. The other one is my Brother who is med-tech in PCGH. My hobbies are cycling, playing  online games, reading manga, and watching moview. After I graduate, I see myself as an application programmer in the company that suits me. I'll save money for a year or so, so that I can start a business on my own. My strength is God, because he is the only one who can help you when no one can. Second is my family, because they're always there to support me when I feel down. The third is curiosity. I'm always curious that I feel everything is interesting to me, and I'm an easy-learner. The weakness that I have is prioritization. I try to do everything all at once, and the way that I try to solve it is by asking for clarification on what needs to be done first. That way, I can focus on what needs to be done right away.</b></p>
